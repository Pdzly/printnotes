### (Aug 22, 2024)

1. Added popup when you try to close app with back button.
2. Added Sync screen in drawer.
3. Added Secure Storage library for sync service credentials (meaning more dependencies required to install üòì).
4. Added a way to upload files and folders to your Nextcloud (actual auto syncing, will add in the future, hopefully soon).
5. Shows the last time you uploaded notes.
6. <u>TODO</u>: Made option to switch WiFi only or WiFi+Cellular upload condition but commented
   it out as I will add it when I figure out notes comparing and merging with sync service.

   (need to figure out how to version app cuz I never done this before ‚îê(Ôø£„ÉòÔø£)‚îå so version will remain till I get sync completed)

## Compiling the app

<details close>
<summary>Tap to show/hide build instructions</summary>

Make sure you have a working flutter sdk setup. If not installed, go to [Install - Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and select your platform.

Be sure to disable signing on build.gradle or change keystore to sign the app.

Before you start building, run these commands:

```
$ flutter channel stable
```

```
$ flutter upgrade
```

After that, building is as simple as running these commands:

```
$ flutter pub get
```

```
$ flutter run
```

```
$ flutter build platform-name
```
